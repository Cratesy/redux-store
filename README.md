## Description

I've been tasked with making a E-commerce store using Redux.

## Installation

```
git clone git@github.com:Cratesy/redux-store.git
cd redux-store
npm install
```

## Usage

```
As a user i am greeted by the homepage which had all products on. I can also click one of the category tabs to filter the products to display only the one that was clicked.
as a user i can add items to my cart which gets stored and then i must be logged in to go to checkout and pay.
as a user i can sign-up, once ive signed up it automatically logs me in.
as a user i can log in if im not already logged in, session expires after 2hrs.
As a user when your logged in you can see your order history on purchases you've made.
as a user i can logout.
